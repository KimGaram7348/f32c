# Video generator test

Short project to build only test screen
output on VGA and HDMI.

As it compiles faster it will speed up 
debugging as well.

On green gradient stripes, there's a
vertical 1-pixel wide green line brighter
than they should be.

When vga driver is built in the larger project
with f32c core then some signal timings are get different
and this green stripe bug doesn't appear
